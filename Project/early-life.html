                    Elon Musk was born to Errol and Maye on June 28, 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. His father was an engineer from South Africa who used to run a 
                    consulting firm along with real estate and mining interests. Errol Musk, his mother was a dietician and model from Canada. Elonâ€™s parents divorced 
                    when he was young. With great enthusiasm for learning, his hobbies comprised of reading, and video gaming. His love in video games led him to computer 
                    programming at the age of nine, he had written his first program when he was twelve years old. The program was a video game software called Blaster, 
                    which was purchased for $500 by a gaming magazine. Along with Musk, Kimbal, his brother had the third IBM personal computer in South Africa.

                    When he was younger, he dreamed of being an entrepreneur. He and Kimbal came up with the plan to build an arcade close to their Pretoria, South Africa, 
                    school when they were thirteen years old. They were told by city officials that in order to get a permit, they needed an adult's signature. Rather of 
                    going after that dream, the brothers concentrated on peddling their own chocolates to fellow students. Musk invested a portion of his income in the stock 
                    market, making hundreds of thousands of dollars.
