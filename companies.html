                    Elon Musk quickly moved gears to his next venture after striking it rich with the Compaq sale. He co-founded and initially headed what was then known
                    as X.com in 1999. The venture received significant funding from notable Silicon Valley tech venture investors. Musk's initial, lofty aim was to 
                    offer a wide variety of financial services through the internet, including bank accounts, insurance, mortgages, mutual funds, and other assets. 
                    Back then, internet banking was an undeveloped and difficult business to get into. Sceptics questioned Musk's ability to develop X.com into a viable
                    online financial institution equivalent to a digital Western Union, given his lack banking history, save for a brief undergraduate stint.

                            <img id="paypal" src="assests/images/paypal.jpg" alt="paypal"><br>
                            In response to this challenge, Musk told Hamilton Spectator's Mark Gimein, he said, his ability to develop a competitive Internet corporation 
                            with a solid base is regarded to be his talent and competence. When Zip2 was launched, he was completely inexperienced with the media sector, 
                            but he learned as he went. It has been noticed that being an outsider creates a more innovative attitude to finding methods to improve the way 
                            things are done. When tactics have been used for years, it is normal for people to stop questioning them, even if they violate logic.<br>
                            <br>
                            Musk combined X.com with a new online financial business, PayPal, in March 2000, which allowed online payments between individuals. PayPal, 
                            like X.com, was rapidly gaining new consumers. PayPal grew into both business-to-consumer and business-to-business areas following the merger. 
                            Users with X.com accounts were given the ability to utilize deposited money to make payments to individuals and companies rapidly using PayPal. 
                            Notably, one of the firms that used PayPal's services was eBay, the auction website. Within months, X.com had 2.5 million user visits in June, and 
                            by the end of October, 2000 it had 300,000 accounts, evidencing the concept's popularity.<br>
                            <br>
                            However, conflicts emerged between Musk and Bill Harris, the CEO and president of X.com after only six months. Musk announced X.com's business 
                            change in October 2000, focusing only on processing payments between parties. Soon after, he announced the renaming of the firm as PayPal. 
                            Significant attention was paid to increasing business-to-consumer and business-to-business activities, along with worldwide development. 
                            Elon also prioritized fraud prevention and security enhancements in reaction to negative publicity around significant fraudulent transactions.

                <p class="text">
                    Elon Musk changed his emphasis to space exploration in 2002, after bringing PayPal public and selling company to eBay for $1.5 billion. He created 
                    SpaceX with $100 million of his own money, with the goal of revolutionizing space travel by substantially lowering prices. Despite initial hiccups, 
                    SpaceX scored a crucial milestone in 2008 when Falcon 1, a privately designed liquid-fuel rocket, successfully orbited the Earth.
                    <span class="dots">....</span><br>
                    <span class="moreText">
                        <br>
                        Musk's rocket projects grew with the development of Falcon 9, which is geared for trips to the International Space Station and beyond. To save 
                        operating and development costs, the corporation prioritized reusability. SpaceX achieved advances in rocket technology, including the successful 
                        test flight of the Grasshopper in 2013. NASA also chose SpaceX's Dragon rocket for manned trips to the International Space Station, resuming 
                        shuttle operations in 2014.<br>
                        <br>

                        Elon Musk's SpaceX was one of the few companies that President Obama hoped would take over space station maintenance once the shuttle retired. 
                        If SpaceX had been successful, it would have hushed detractors and secured a $1.6 billion contract with NASA, establishing it as the major 
                        carrier of supplies and, eventually, humans. This would have propelled Musk to the status of a 21st-century tycoon, deriving cash from space 
                        projects. SpaceX has outperformed competitors financed by Jeff Bezos and Paul Allen, as well as aerospace behemoths Boeing and Lockheed Martin, 
                        with over $4 billion in contracts and more than 40 missions already booked.<br>
                        <br>
                        Musk, on the other hand, saw his endeavors on a far grander scale. He hoped to colonize Mars, insuring humanity's existence regardless of what 
                        happened to Earth. Musk saw this as a gigantic insurance policy for all of humanity, and he expected to achieve it within the next 20 years. 
                        He was upbeat about the progress being made.<br>
                        <br>
                        During a voyage to the International Space Station in 2015, a Falcon 9 rocket encountered a mid-air explosion, resulting in cargo loss. 
                        The likely reason, according to Musk, is an over pressurized oxidizer tank. Despite this setback, SpaceX maintained its aim to make space 
                        travel more accessible and affordable, marking a watershed moment in the future of space exploration.

                <p class="text">
                    The initial founders of Tesla, engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, laid the groundwork for the company's 2003 incorporation. The automaker's
                    well-known face, Elon Musk, did not join as a founding member. Rather, he joined the scene in 2004 and contributed a significant amount of the $6.35 
                    million of the $6.5 million first Series A capital. As a result of this investment, Eberhard became CEO of Tesla and Musk became chairman.
                    <span class="dots">....</span><br>
                    <span class="moreText">
                        <br>
                        Eberhard's time in office was brief, though, as he resigned in August 2007 after a disagreement with Musk about authority. As a result, early 
                        Tesla investor Michael Marks filled the post of acting CEO until November of the same year, at which point Ze'ev Drori, the creator of Monolithic 
                        Memories, took over.<br>
                        <br>
                        In 2008, Marc Tarpenning left at the same time as Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, went into production. Musk cemented his powerful position 
                        inside the firm by becoming the CEO post in October of the same year.<br>
                        <br>
                        Tesla needed assistance while it was having financial difficulties in 2009 due to the recession. They obtained a $465 million government loan and 
                        sold 10% of the company to Daimler. In spite of the difficult circumstances, Tesla debuted a Model S prototype in the same year. CEO disputes 
                        continued, and in June 2009 Martin Eberhard filed a lawsuit, claiming Elon Musk had driven him out and had falsified Tesla's founding history.<br>
                        <br>
                        <img id="tesla" src="assests/images/tesla.jpg" alt="tesla"><br>
                        Unexpectedly, in September 2009, Eberhard and Musk reached an agreement wherein they would jointly hold the title of cofounder alongside Marc 
                        Tarpenning and three other individuals. Musk is listed as the CEO and cofounder of Tesla on the company's official account. The Model S was 
                        formally introduced for sale in 2012, and Tesla went public in 2010 at a price of $17 per share. Musk unveiled the Model X later that year, 
                        extending Tesla's vehicle range with its unique gullwing doors.<br>
                        <br>
                        One of the most contentious aspects of Tesla, Autopilot, which offers driving assistance, was launched by Musk in 2014. Some claim that the word 
                        "Autopilot" may suggest a degree of vehicle autonomy that it does not. Even while utilizing Autopilot, Tesla requires its drivers to be attentive 
                        and maintain their hands on the wheel. However, as Rick Newman of Yahoo Finance noted last year, the function has been linked to accidents, 
                        including at least 11 deadly ones.

                <p class="text">
                    Neuralink is Musk's brain-implant company, it has recently obtained permission from an impartial review body to begin accepting patients for its human 
                    trial for the first time. The goal of the six-year project is to test the experimental gadget on paralyzed subjects.

                        Several businesses, including Neuralink, are developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that could record and decipher brain signals. However, 
                        academics and neuroscientists are skeptical about Musk's audacious claims about creating a universal brain-computer interface and have raised 
                        ethical questions.<br>
                        <br>
                        <img id="neuralink" src="assests/images/neuralink.jpg" alt="neuralink"><br>
                        The company's request for faster human studies was first denied by the Food and Drug Administration last year. On the other hand, Neuralink was 
                        granted permission for an experimental device exemption in May, which allowed for clinical research. How the agency handled its first concerns is 
                        a matter of public record.<br>
                        <br>
                        Neuralink is particularly looking for people who have ALS or spinal cord injuries that have left them quadriplegic. They will have a BCI surgically 
                        implanted in a part of the brain that controls movement, under the guidance of a patented robot. The idea is to give them the ability to use their 
                        thoughts to control a computer cursor or keyboard. The evaluation of the technology's usability and safety is the main goal of the research.<br>
                        <br>
                        The experiment was given regulatory permission before this news was made, but the company's previous animal research is still being investigated. 
                        There have been rumors of trials that upset people unnecessarily, and former workers have called them hurried and vague. According to reports, 
                        the gadget was once implanted in pigs erroneously, which resulted in the killing of the animals.<br>
                        <br>
                        These claims have sparked a few investigations, including probes into animal welfare from the Department of Agriculture and improper handling of 
                        biohazardous chemicals over state boundaries from the Department of Transportation.<br>
                        <br>
                        When asked about the trial's schedule, location, or number of participants, the firm has not yet replied. Even if the gadget turns out to be safe 
                        for human usage, it may be decades before it is approved for use outside of the study.

                <p class="text">Elon Musk, well-known for his involvement with many tech enterprises, began a new endeavor with a tweet in 2016: The Boring Company. Musk 
                    quickly conceptualized the notion of developing a tunnel boring machine to reduce traffic congestion, fueled by dissatisfaction with traffic. He was 
                    dead set on making this notion a reality.
                    <span class="dots">....</span><br>

                        <br><br>
                        The Boring Company's first project began in February 2017, and it resulted in the completion of three endeavors: the R&D Tunnel, the Hyperloop Test 
                        Track, and the Las Vegas Convention Centre. The business is now concentrating on the ambitious 68-mile Vegas Loop, which would eventually connect 
                        Las Vegas and Los Angeles.<br>
                        <br>
                        According to recent sources, The Boring Company's worth has risen to an estimated $7 billion following a share sale by workers and investors, a 
                        22% increase over the last investment round. Shares were valued at $24, up from $19 in the previous Series C investment round in April of the 
                        previous year. Investors were given the option of purchasing up to $20 million in secondary shares.<br>

                        The company's main selling point is its capacity to use cutting-edge technology to revolutionize tunnelling. The Prufrock machine, which is now in 
                        use, can excavate around one mile each week, revolutionizing tunnel construction. It is believed that future versions will be considerably more 
                        efficient.<br>
                        <br>
                        Musk confirmed the prospect of mining over 10,000 miles of tunnel and reaching a $1 trillion valuation by 2030 in response to questions about the 
                        company's exponential expansion. While the technology was viable, he observed that the key problem was gaining the requisite licenses, given the 
                        rising challenges in construction projects in North America and Europe.
