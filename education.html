                    He moved to Canada at the age of seventeen and began college at Queen's University in Kingston. He easily obtained a Canadian passport 
                    because his mother was a Canadian citizen. The main reason he moved to Canada was to avoid the compulsion of serving the military in South
                    Africa. During his time as a student he picked up internships at several institutes, for instance, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the marketing 
                    department of Microsoft Canada and also as a program developer at Rocket Science.

                    In 1995, with the  help of financial aid, Musk promptly started at the University of Pennsylvania. He pursued economics as an undergraduate at 
                    Penn's Wharton School of Business. He then worked for another year to obtain a physics bachelor’s degree. Later on, he moved to the West to get 
                    a PhD in physics at Stanford University majoring in capacitors. Since, he always wanted to be an entrepreneur he left within two days of completion 
                    to begin his business venture, believing it would present him with greater chances. In an interview for Business Investor’s Daily he told Brian 
                    Deagon that he believed internet could change the course of humans drastically in future, and that was something he wished to be a part of.
